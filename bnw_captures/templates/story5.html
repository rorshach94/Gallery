            <h1>HARUKI</h1>
    </h1>

    <h2 class="neonText" style="font-style: italic;" align="center"><p>In the year 2023, a rare celestial event was poised to cast its eerie shadow over the small town of Siberia. As the total solar eclipse approached, whispers of foreboding swept through the community, but no one could have anticipated the macabre horrors that would unfold.</p>

        <p>The day of the eclipse arrived, and the sky grew progressively darker as the moon edged in front of the sun. The town's inhabitants gathered in the central square, their gazes locked on the celestial phenomenon above. As the moon's shadow cast an otherworldly darkness, an unsettling silence settled over the crowd.</p>
        
        <p>Just as the sun was fully obscured, an unearthly wailing pierced the air. The townspeople turned to see a spectral figure standing atop a nearby hill, its ethereal form illuminated by an eerie, cold light that seemed to emanate from within. Its hollow eyes bore into the crowd, instilling a sense of dread that chilled them to their bones.</p>
        
        <p>As the eclipse reached its peak, the spectral figure's wailing intensified, reverberating through the air and resonating deep within the souls of those who heard it. Slowly, one by one, members of the crowd began to collapse, their bodies convulsing uncontrollably. Panic and horror spread like wildfire as people realized the eclipse had brought forth a malevolent force that defied explanation.</p>
        
        <p>Within moments, the sky began to fracture, and a hauntingly beautiful yet terrifying rift tore open above the town. From it emerged an army of shadowy figures, their elongated limbs and twisted forms casting grotesque silhouettes against the darkened landscape. They moved with unnatural grace, gliding down to the ground as if borne on the wind itself.</p>
        
        <p>Chaos erupted as the shadowy beings descended upon the townspeople. Their touch brought a freezing, bone-chilling cold that drained the life from those unfortunate enough to come into contact. The air grew thick with the stench of death as the once-lively streets turned into a nightmarish battleground.
        
        Amid the chaos, a group of survivors managed to retreat to the town's dilapidated church, hoping to find sanctuary within its walls. But even there, they were not safe. The specters surrounded the building, their wailing growing louder and more maddening with each passing second.</p>
        
        <p>As the eclipse began to wane and the moon's grip on the sun loosened, the spectral figures seemed to lose their strength. With a final, chilling wail, they retreated back into the rift from whence they came, leaving behind a town in ruins and survivors scarred by the macabre horror they had witnessed.
        
        The eclipse ended, and the sun's light once again bathed the town in its warmth. The survivors emerged from their sanctuary, shaken and traumatized, to find their once-peaceful home forever changed by the nightmarish events of that day. The celestial phenomenon that had captured the world's attention had unleashed a terror beyond imaginationâ€”a macabre horror that would haunt their memories for the rest of their lives.</p>
